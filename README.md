# FinalProject
Softwarecamp E-Commercial App. I used Asp.Net Core layered architecture, wep api, entity framework and local db.

We can do crud operations and other operations(get by id, get all etc) to product, order, customer and category. I used sql server and used foreign key for relation between this tables.

When I made this app, I used layered architecture . Layers are Entity, DataAcces, Business, Core(same codes all project) and I used Console for UI. I used Web Api and tested this in Postman.
I used entity framework to ORM.
I also added autofac for IoC,fluent validation, caching, transaction, performance, serilog for cross cutting concerns and add AOP support.
